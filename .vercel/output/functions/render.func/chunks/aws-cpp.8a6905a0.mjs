Do not use the root user for everyday tasks.\n\n- Create an AWS account this established your root user identity\n- Create your first IAM user and give it permissions to create other users\n- Login as the new IAM user and continue to create other users\n- Only acccess the root user for a limitee number of tasks\n\n**IAM Users**\n: Is an identity that you create in AWS. It represents the person / application that interacts with AWS services and resources. Consist of names and credentials. - by default, when you create a new IAM user in AWS, it has no permissions associated with it.\n\n> BEST PRACTICE\n\n<mark>We recommend that you create individual IAM users for each person who needs to access AWS.</mark>\n\n**IAM Policies**\n: An IAM policy is a document that allows or denies permisions to AWS services and resoruces. Allows you to customize user level of access to resouces.\n\n> BEST PRACTICE\n\n<mark>Follow the security principles of least privilege when granting permission</mark>\n\n**IAM Groups**\n: Is a collection of IAM users. When you assign an IAM policy to a group, all users in the group are granted permissions specified by the policy. One way to manage your users and their permissoins is to organise them into IAM groups.\n\n**IAM Roles**\n: Is an identity that you can assume to gain temporary access to permissions. Before an IAM user, application or service can assume an IAM role, they must be granted permission to switch to the role. When someone assumes an IAM role, they drop all previous permissions they had under a previous role and assume the premission of the new role.\n\n> BEST PRACTICE\n\n<mark>IAM roles are ideal for situations in which access to services or resources needs to be granted temporarily instead of long-time.</mark>\n\n**AWS Organizations**\n\nA central location to mange multiple AWS accounts.\n\n- Centralized management\n- Consolidated billing\n- Hierarchical groupings of accounts\n- AWS service and API actions access control (Services control Policies(SCPs)).\n\n<mark>You cannot apply IAM policies to IAM users, groups or roles. You cannnot apply an IAM policy to the AWS account root user.</mark>\n\n**AWS Artifact**\n\nIs a service that provides on-demand access to AWS security and compliance reports and select online agreements. AWS artifacts consists of two main sections:\n\n- <mark>AWS Artifacts Agreements and AWS Artifact Reports</mark>\n\n**Denial of Service Attacks**\n\n- Security Policy can help against UDP Floods\n- ELB can help against slow loris attacks\n- <span style=\"color:red\">AWS Shield is a service protects applications against DDoS attacks.</span>\n- <span style=\"color:red\">AWS WAF uses a web application firewall to filter incoming traffic with the signature of bad actors.</span>\n\n**Additional Security Services**\n\n**AWS Key Management Service (KMS)**\n: is used to manage cryptographic/encryption keys on AWS\n\n- Encryption at rest -> DynamoDB data\n- Encrypton in transit -> SSL\n\n**Amazon Inspector**\n: runs automated security accessment against your infrastructure\n\n**Amazon GuardDuty**\n: It analyses contineous streams of metadata generated from your account and network activity.\n\n---\n\n### Serverless\n\nYou cannot see or access the underlying infrastructure.\n\nAWS Lambda is a serverless option suited for quick processing like web application backend.\n\n- AWS Container Services: Container orchestration tool.\n- Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)\n- Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)\n- AWS Fargate: It is a serverless computer platformm for ECS and EKS\n\n---\n\n### Storage and Databases\n\n<span style=\"color:orange\">- Block level storage - Hard Drive</style>\n\n**Instance Store**\n: are used to store temporary files and data that can be easily recreated without consequences.\n\n**Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)**\n: Virtual hard drive or EBS volumes.

Trusted Advisor evaluates your account by using checks. These checks identify ways to optimize your AWS infrastructure, improve security and performance, reduce costs, and monitor service quotas. You can then follow the check recommendations to optimize your services and resources.\n\nTrusted Advisor can help you save cost, such as recommending you to delete unused or idle resources, or use reserved capacity.\n\n**Amazon CloudWatch** - Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service and provides you with data and actionable insights to monitor your applications, respond to system-wide performance changes, and optimize resource utilization. CloudWatch collects monitoring and operational data in the form of logs, metrics, and events. You get a unified view of operational health and gain complete visibility of your AWS resources, applications, and services running on AWS and on-premises. You can use CloudWatch to detect anomalous behavior in your environments, set alarms, visualize logs and metrics side by side, take automated actions, troubleshoot issues, and discover insights to keep your applications running smoothly.\n\n**AWS Cost Explorer** - AWS Cost Explorer has an easy-to-use interface that helps you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over a daily or monthly granularity. It has a default report that helps you visualize the costs and usage associated with your top five cost-accruing AWS services, and gives you a detailed breakdown of all services in the table view. The reports let you adjust the time range to view historical data going back up to twelve months to gain an understanding of your cost trends. It also lets you dive deeper using granular filtering and grouping dimensions such as Usage Type and Tags.\n\n**Amazon Inspector** - Amazon Inspector is an automated security assessment service that helps improve the security and compliance of applications deployed on AWS. Amazon Inspector automatically assesses applications for exposure, vulnerabilities, and deviations from best practices. After performing an assessment, Amazon Inspector produces a detailed list of security findings prioritized by level of severity. These findings can be reviewed directly or as part of detailed assessment reports, which are available via the Amazon Inspector console or API.\n\n**AWS Service Health Dashboard** - AWS publishes the most up-to-the-minute information on service availability in the Service Health Dashboard. You can visit any time to get the current status and availability information for each individual service. AWS Service Health Dashboard is available at this link: [https://status.aws.amazon.com](https://status.aws.amazon.com/)\n\n**AWS Personal Health Dashboard** - The Personal Health Dashboard gives you a personalized view of the status of AWS services that power your applications. Use the Personal Health Dashboard to learn about specific operational issues that affect your account. For example, if you receive an event for a lost Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume associated with one of your Amazon EC2 instances, you can use the event to quickly view the status of your impacted resources, and then troubleshoot and determine remediation steps.\n\n**AWS Config** - AWS Config enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. Config continuously monitors and records your AWS resource configurations and allows you to automate the evaluation of recorded configurations against desired configurations. With Config, you can review changes in configurations and relationships between AWS resources, dive into detailed resource configuration histories, and determine your overall compliance against the configurations specified in your internal guidelines.\n\n**AWS CloudFormation** - AWS CloudFormation gives you an easy way to model a collection of related AWS and third-party resources, provision them quickly and consistently, and manage them throughout their lifecycles, by treating infrastructure as code. A CloudFormation template describes your desired resources and their dependencies so you can launch and configure them together as a stack. You can use a template to create, update, and delete an entire stack as a single unit, as often as you need to, instead of managing resources individually. You can manage and provision stacks across multiple AWS accounts and AWS Regions.\n\n**AWS CloudTrail** - AWS CloudTrail monitors and records account activity across your AWS infrastructure, giving you control over storage, analysis, and remediation actions. With CloudTrail, you can log, continuously monitor, and retain account activity related to actions across your AWS infrastructure.\n\nCloudTrail provides event history of your AWS Accounts. CloudTrail Events help you answer the questions of \"who did what, where, and when?\".  Let's say your S3 bucket was deleted by mistake. You can use AWS CloudTrail to see who deleted the bucket, when, and where (e.g. API Call or from the AWS Management console).\n\n**AWS Elastic Load Balancing** - Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) is an AWS service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions, and ensures only healthy targets receive traffic. It can handle the varying load of your application traffic in a single Availability Zone or across multiple AZs, and supports the ability to load balance across AWS and on-premises resources in the same load balancer.\n";
